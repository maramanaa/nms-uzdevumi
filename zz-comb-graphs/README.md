Markdown may contain formulas in LaTeX. Delimit those with single $ (inline formulas), or double $$ (page-wide formulas). 
Images can be replaced by Markdown code like this: 
```
![](ZZ.C_GRAPHS.30415.png) ... replace by the image named after the problem number.
```
Please keep the original language and do not modify the text in any way.
